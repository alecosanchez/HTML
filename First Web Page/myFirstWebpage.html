<h1>Web Page Designed by Aleco Sanchez</h1>
<p>This is the first web page I have ever created. 
I have experience in other programming languages like Python and Java so I am very excited to be experimenting with HTML and front end web design!
I am very eager to learn HTML and see how my webpages can improve in both <i>design</i> and <b>functionality!</b> Building this webpages
has been challenging but I am very satisfied with how it came out!
